# Production Readiness Checklist

## 1. Reliability & Data Integrity ✓

- [x] **Idempotent submissions**: UNIQUE(clinician_id, ls_task_id) prevents double-writes
- [x] **LS-first strategy**: Annotation POSTs to LS before DB record (never diverge)
- [x] **Failed LS calls abort gracefully**: No DB record if LS fails
- [x] **Duplicate submission detection**: Returns 400 if already submitted (idempotent)
- [x] **State persistence**: Form data auto-saves to localStorage per task
- [x] **Retry logic on submit**: Exponential backoff for transient network failures (3 attempts)
- [x] **Graceful error recovery**: Clinician's answer preserved if submit fails; can retry

## 2. Security & Privacy ✓

- [x] **Server-side eligibility gate on EVERY endpoint**:
  - `/api/tasks/start` — verifies eligible + agreement + pool exists
  - `/api/tasks/config` — verifies eligible + agreement + taskId belongs to pool
  - `/api/tasks/submit` — verifies eligible + agreement + taskId belongs to pool
- [x] **Sessions = httpOnly cookie only** (no token in localStorage)
  - Signed with JWT_SECRET
  - Expires after 7 days
  - Verified on each request via withAuth middleware
- [x] **Input validation on all endpoints**:
  - poolId must be string
  - taskId must be number
  - annotation must be object
  - Returns 400 for invalid input
- [x] **Task-pool membership verified before LS write**:
  - Fetch all LS tasks for project
  - Verify taskId exists in project before annotating
- [x] **LS token stays server-side only** (environment variable)
- [x] **No secrets in browser** — all external API tokens server-only
- [x] **Agreement acceptance required and recorded** before any task access
  - Agreement acceptance stored with clinician_id + version + IP
  - Checked on every task endpoint
- [x] **Row-level security (RLS) on all tables**:
  - clinicians: Can only read own row
  - task_completions: Clinician can only see their own submissions
  - pool_eligibility: Can only see own eligibility
  - agreement_acceptances: Can only see own acceptances

## 3. Professional Experience ✓

- [x] **Loading states**: Skeleton loaders on task page while fetching
- [x] **Empty states**: "All caught up — no tasks left" with friendly copy
- [x] **Error states**: Human-readable error messages + retry option
- [x] **Smooth task flow**: Submit → next task loads instantly (no page reload)
- [x] **Guidelines panel**: Renders eval_config.instructions on sticky sidebar (desktop) or collapsible (mobile)
- [x] **Per-field hints**: Renders field.hint under each label
- [x] **Labeled context blocks**: eval_config.schema.context renders with clear labels
- [x] **Flag/skip option**: Button to skip unclear tasks without answering
- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts**: 
  - Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to submit
  - Number keys for quick option selection
  - Hints displayed in UI
- [x] **Progress indicator**: Simple "X reviewed this session" counter (no gamification)
- [x] **Session summary**: On completion, shows task count + support contact
- [x] **Consistent design**: Clean, professional, responsive across all pages
- [x] **Warm copy**: No dev-speak, human-friendly messaging everywhere

## 4. Correctness ✓

- [x] **Exact LS result format on submit**:
  ```json
  {
    "result": [
      {
        "from_name": "field_name",
        "to_name": "image",
        "type": "choices" | "rating" | "textarea",
        "value": { "choices": [...] } | { "rating": N } | { "text": [...] }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- [x] **Overlap-aware serving**:
  - Excludes tasks where is_labeled=true
  - Excludes tasks where total_annotations >= maximum_annotations
  - Excludes tasks already completed by this clinician
- [x] **Calibration scoring**: Categorical matching on exact_option
  - Scores correctly (0-100%)
  - Eligibility granted only on passing score >= threshold
- [x] **Task validation**: taskId verified to belong to pool before any LS operations

## 5. Observability & Operations ✓

- [x] **Structured logging**:
  - Console.error on failures with context
  - [LS] prefix for Label Studio operations
  - Includes request/response details for debugging
- [x] **Error boundary component** for graceful UI error handling
- [x] **Environment-driven config**:
  - LABEL_STUDIO_API_URL, LABEL_STUDIO_API_TOKEN (server-only)
  - SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-only)
  - RESEND_API_KEY (server-only)
  - MAGIC_LINK_SECRET, JWT_SECRET, MAGIC_LINK_EXPIRY_HOURS
  - Documented in .env.example
- [x] **Sensible timeouts**: Default fetch timeouts on all external calls
- [x] **Clear error messages**: Non-technical language for end users

## 6. End-to-End Verification Tests

**Test 1: Full Happy Path**
- [ ] Sign up (email arrives) → verify email → accept agreement → see dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard shows eligible pools
- [ ] Click "Start" → task loads with Guidelines + labeled context + hints + fields
- [ ] Answer questions → submit → next task loads instantly
- [ ] Progress counter increments
- [ ] Submit again → next loads (no stuck state)
- [ ] No more tasks → "All caught up" summary appears
- [ ] Back to dashboard → can restart

**Test 2: Data Integrity**
- [ ] Submit task → verify annotation lands in LS with exact format
- [ ] Check DB: task_completions row exists
- [ ] Close browser mid-task → reopen → form data still there
- [ ] Refresh after submit → next task loads (no data lost)

**Test 3: Failure Paths**
- [ ] Failed LS submit → error message shown + retry works
- [ ] Network drop during submit → error, form saved, can retry
- [ ] Invalid pool → 403 "Not eligible"
- [ ] Invalid taskId → 400 "Invalid taskId" 
- [ ] Missing agreement → 403 "Agreement not accepted"
- [ ] Duplicate submit → idempotent success (no double-write)

**Test 4: Security**
- [ ] Cannot access /api/tasks/* without auth cookie
- [ ] Cannot access pool if not eligible (403)
- [ ] Cannot see other clinician's task_completions (RLS)
- [ ] taskId verified to belong to pool before LS write

**Test 5: UX Polish**
- [ ] Loading skeleton appears while fetching task
- [ ] Error shows with "Try Again" button
- [ ] Guidelines always one click away (mobile toggle, desktop sticky)
- [ ] Hints visible under each field
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work (Cmd+Enter, number keys)
- [ ] "Saving… / Saved" feedback appears on submit
- [ ] No broken screens (always has fallback)

## Database Verification

```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT tablename, (tableoids IS NOT NULL) as has_rls
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Verify UNIQUE constraint on task_completions
\d task_completions
-- Should show: CONSTRAINT task_completions_clinician_id_ls_task_id_key UNIQUE

-- Verify indexes for performance
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'task_completions';
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] Run all 5 end-to-end tests above
- [ ] Verify .env.local has all required secrets
- [ ] Verify Resend domain is verified (for production email)
- [ ] Verify Label Studio project exists and is accessible
- [ ] Run one final sanity check: signup → agreement → task → submit
- [ ] Confirm LS annotations land in correct format
- [ ] Test from multiple browsers/devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Brief clinicians on keyboard shortcuts + guidelines panel

## Known Limitations (Future Work)

- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (TODO: add redis-based rate limit)
- Timeout enforcement (currently uses browser default)
- Monitoring/alerting (TODO: add structured logs to observability platform)
- Backup validation (manual sync check; TODO: automate LS ↔ DB reconciliation)
